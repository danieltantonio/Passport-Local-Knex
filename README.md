That's about it...

## Uhm... why?
Being a big fan of NoSQL, I was really into using MongoDB for almost all of my projects. One day I got more and more into FOSS (Free/OpenSource Software) and heard of MariaDB. It is both a faster and open source fork of MySQL. After learning (enough) of MariaDB I wanted to see if I can somehow implement a login session with cookies. This is my attempt. I made an older project of this as well but it didn't go well, so I deleted it and made this one instead. 

If anyone can tell me why it works when importing the `local.js`file as passport instead of importing passport normally PLEASE! PLEEEEEASE let me know. Thank you.
